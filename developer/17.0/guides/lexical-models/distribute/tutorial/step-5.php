<h1>Step 5: Compiling, testing and distributing a Package</h1>

<p>In the Package Editor, click on the <span class="guibutton">Compile</span> tab.</p>

<p><img src="<?php echo cdn("img/developer/120/lm/tutorial_distribute_model_compile.png"); ?>" /></p>

<p>Click <span class="guibutton">Compile Package</span> to compile the package into a .kmp file. Compiling takes all the files listed
for the package, compresses them (using a .ZIP-compatible format) and adds the package information, all into a single file. If any
files are not available, an error will be listed in the Messages window.</p>

<p>After compiling, you can test the package installation in the mobile Keyman apps.
  You should test that all the model installs successfully, that the Welcome file is displayed
during the install, and that the documentation is accessible to the end user.</p>

<h2>Distributing a package on the Keyman Cloud Lexical Model Repository</h2>

<p>Once you have tested the package to your satisfaction, it is time to distribute it. We recommend submitting your
  lexical model package to the <a href="https://github.com/keymanapp/lexical-models">Keyman Lexical Models Repository</a></p>

<h2>Distributing a package on your own website</h2>

<p>If you distribute a package on your own site, we have the following recommendations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure the MIME type on the web server or folder for .KMP files is set up to application/octet-stream. Without
    this, .KMP files may be recognised as .ZIP files -- this is not helpful to the end user as it will be opened in the wrong
    application.</li>

  <li>Avoid putting the .KMP file in an archive (e.g. .ZIP) or self-expanding archive (.EXE) - this makes it harder for end users
    to install. A .KMP file is already compressed (it is actually just a ZIP archive file!) and you won't save much space by
    recompressing it.</li>

  <li>Include a link to the Keyman download page: http://keyman.com/downloads/</li>
</ol>
<h2>Distributing a package by email</h2>
<li>Attaching the KMP file directly to an email may be blocked for security reasons. As mentioned above, a KMP file is
  basically a ZIP file and lexical model data is in JavaScript, this is a combination that looks suspicious to many
  email servers. You can upload it to a Google drive, and email a link for downloading the file</li>

<h2>Installing the lexical model package</h2>
<li>The same method for installing custom keyboard packages to mobile devices can be used for installing lexical model packages.
  Refer to these pages for <a href="../../../distribute/install-kmp-ios">Keyman for iPhone and iPad</a>
  and <a href="../../../distribute/install-kmp-android">Keyman for Android</a>.</li>
